  It is highly recommended to download FFmpeg [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or place the `ffmpeg` file in the same folder as the script.

- **Required Libraries**: The script will automatically install all necessary libraries upon the first run. These include:
  - [aiohttp](https://docs.aiohttp.org/)

  - [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
  
  The tool uses these libraries to perform its core functions. I accept no responsibility for any problems that may arise from their use.
